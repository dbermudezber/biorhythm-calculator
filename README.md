# Biorhythm Calculator
A calculator that uses your birthday to generate charts based on your claimed physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles, based on the biorhythm theory. 

# Description
The biorhythm calculator is meant to help individuals better understand and track their natural cycles. It is believed that physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles influence daily performance, moods, and decision-making. This concept is based on the theory that, from birth, humans experience recurring cycles, characterized by 23 days of physical energy, 28 days of emotional balance, and 33 days of mental acuity. This calculator is meant to use the individual's birthdate and the current date to generate a graph and numerical values representing favorable, unfavorable, and critical moments of each cycle. Learning these insights will help support better planning, productivity, and self-awareness by identifying the days where a person has points of strength and weakness.
